# MM_LabRats
A maze-running game where the player controls a lab rat in increasingly complex mazes. Find the cheese as fast as you can!

Mazes are procedurally generated using recursive backtracking for different mazes every time you play.

Controls:
Move = WASD
Sniff out the cheese (temporarily reveal maze solution) = E
Poop (leave a permanent marker to remember where you've been) = Q
